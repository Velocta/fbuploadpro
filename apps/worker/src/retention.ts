// ==========================================
// Retention cleanup job (spec 139 residue — CTO ceiling #3)
// ==========================================
//
// Shahzeb ruled 2026-10-24: publish history is retained 30 DAYS.
// `publish_logs` and `queue_items` are the two unbounded-growth tables
// of the publishing engine; without this job they are the first
// storage wall at certified volume.
//
// A SEPARATE scheduled job (cron `0 2 * * *` — daily 02:00 UTC, see
// wrangler.toml) that calls the cleanup RPC
// `cleanup_expired_publish_history` (migration
// 20261024120000_retention_cleanup.sql) in a bounded loop:
//
//   - The RPC deletes ONE batch round per call (up to
//     RETENTION_BATCH_SIZE rows per table per call), so every call is
//     its own short transaction — row locks are released between
//     batches and no single statement can lock or flood the tables.
//   - This loop keeps calling until a round comes back short for BOTH
//     tables (nothing expired remains) or RETENTION_MAX_BATCHES_PER_RUN
//     rounds have run — a run is always bounded; a backlog larger than
//     one run's cap simply continues on the next daily run. The RPC's
//     predicates only ever match expired rows, so the job is
//     IDEMPOTENT: re-running after a partial or interrupted run is a
//     no-op beyond the remaining expired rows.
//
// What is deleted (the terminal-only guarantee lives in the RPC and is
// proven by the SQL rig in tests/retention-rpc):
//   - publish_logs rows older than the cutoff whose parent queue item
//     is TERMINAL (published / failed / cancelled). Logs of live items
//     (queued / publishing) are never touched at any age.
//   - queue_items rows in a terminal state whose `updated_at` — the
//     terminal timestamp; a settled row is never written again — is
//     older than the cutoff. Their remaining logs cascade-delete.
//   Live work can never match: both predicates whitelist terminal
//   statuses instead of blacklisting live ones.
//
// Kill-switch / dry-run (worker env, read per run):
//   - RETENTION_DISABLED = 'true' (or '1') skips the run entirely.
//     The job is ENABLED BY DEFAULT: the retention policy is ruled, and
//     a default-off flag would silently recreate the unbounded-growth
//     problem this job exists to close. The flag exists so an operator
//     can stop deletion immediately without a deploy.
//   - RETENTION_DRY_RUN = 'true' (or '1') makes one count-only RPC
//     call: the run logs the full counts a real run would delete and
//     removes nothing — the first-run / incident verification mode.
//
// Observability: every run logs ONE structured counter line (counts
// only — never row contents, ids, or captions). An RPC failure is
// captured to PostHog and rethrown so the cron invocation reports the
// failure; the next daily run retries whatever remains.
